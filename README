NAME
    IMS::CP::Manifest - IMS Content Packaging Manifest XML parser

VERSION
    version 0.0.1

DESCRIPTION
    This is a simple (read-only) parser for IMS Content Packaging manifest
    XML files. The specification is available from
    <http://www.imsglobal.org/content/packaging/index.html>. It is still
    incomplete, but it enables you to get access to the organization of all
    the resources in the manifest and their associated files (and titles).

ATTRIBUTES
  namespace_map
    The prefixes "cp" and "lom" are declared for use in XPath queries.

  title
    The main title of the manifest.

  organizations
    A list of organizations of content. Organizations are basically
    different ways to organize the content in the package, e.g. linear or
    hierarchial.
